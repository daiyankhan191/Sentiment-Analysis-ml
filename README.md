# Sentiment Analysis using Machine Learning

This is a simple machine learning project that performs sentiment analysis on text data. The model classifies text into *positive, **negative, or **neutral* sentiment using various NLP techniques and machine learning algorithms.

## Features
- Text preprocessing (stopword removal, tokenization, stemming)
- Vectorization using TF-IDF
- Multiple ML models (Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, etc.)
- Accuracy comparison and evaluation metrics

## Tech Stack
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas, NumPy
- NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)
- Jupyter Notebook

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   https://github.com/yourusername/sentiment-analysis-ml.git

2. Navigate to the project folder:
   cd sentiment-analysis-ml

3. Install the required libraries
   pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Run the jupyter notebook or Pythone script


## Results
The Logistic Regression model achieved over *90.5% accuracy* on the test dataset.

## Future Improvements
- Expand dataset
- Integrate with a web UI using Flask
- Use deep learning models (e.g., LSTM)
